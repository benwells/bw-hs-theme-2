                    <p class="lead">Marc is a seasoned clinician who uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in his work with clients. CBT focuses on exploring relationships among a person's thoughts, feelings and behaviors. During CBT Marc actively works with clients to uncover unhealthy patterns of thought and how they may be causing self-destructive behaviors and beliefs.</p>
                    <p class="lead">By addressing these patterns, the client and Marc work together to develop constructive ways of thinking that will produce healthier behaviors and beliefs. For instance, CBT can help clients replace thoughts that lead to low self-esteem ("I can't do anything right") with positive expectations ("I can do this most of the time, based on my prior experiences").</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-2 col-sm-6">
                    <p class="lead">The core principles of CBT are identifying negative or false beliefs and testing or restructuring them. Oftentimes clients being treated with CBT will have homework in between sessions where they practice replacing negative thoughts with more realistic thoughts based on prior experiences or record their negative thoughts in a journal.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Studies of CBT have shown it to be an effective treatment for a wide variety of mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating disorders and schizophrenia. Individuals who undergo CBT show changes in brain activity, suggesting that this therapy actually improves your brain functioning as well. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has a considerable amount of scientific data supporting its use.</p>
